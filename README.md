# PersonalExpenses

Personal Expenses is an iOS and Android app built with Flutter that connects with the Notion API to visualize spending trends by category and individual purchases that can be inputted through a Notion project workspace. The Notion Web and Desktop interfaces allow a convenient way to input purchase data into the app, and the app will consequently help the users understand a breakdown of their spending categories. This app also practices good design choices by isolating various data models and UI widgets for reusabilty and extensibility purposes.
